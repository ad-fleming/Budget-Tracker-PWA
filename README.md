# Budget-Tracker-PWA

Budget Tracker is a PWA designed to track user budget with persistent data supported by a MongoDb Atlas database. We were tasked with adding functionality to an existing app allowing for offline access and funcitonality.

This projects was designed to expose us to foundational concepts for developing PWAs.

Please see Acceptance Criteria and Links below.


## User Story
AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

## Business Context

Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.


## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a user is on Budget App without an internet connection
WHEN the user inputs a withdrawal or deposit
THEN that will be shown on the page, and added to their transaction history when their connection is back online.
